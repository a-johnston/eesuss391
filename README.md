## Project 4: Reinforcement Learning Agent
Eric Luan (efl11), Adam Johnston (amj69)

In this project, an agent uses the Q-learning algorithm to iteratively learn
how to pit footmen against footmen. It uses six features which are described in
the code. The Q-learning implementation and related helpers are also documented.
