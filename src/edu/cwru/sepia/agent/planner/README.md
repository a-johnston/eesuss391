## Project 3: Forward State Space Planning
Eric Luan (efl11), Adam Johnston (amj69)

This is the code for a forward state space planning agent in SEPIA. The agent's goal is to collect a predefined amount of gold and wood as quicky as possible. The agent controls peasants which can move, deposit, and harvest. The agent also has a townhall which can build peasants. Building a peasant consumes 400 gold and 1 food (a total of 3 food is available). 

Strips-like descriptions can be found in the class level javadoc comments for each Action class file.
